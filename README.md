This folder is dedicated to my work with crytopgraphy and cryptocurrenceis in C++

**Note:** This is my first time working with C++ and exanding my knowledge of programming languages

## Java Folder

This folder is dedicated to my work with crytopgraphy and cryptocurrenceis in Java.
As of this moment, this is the most developed folder as Java is my strongest programming language, so I am starting my research in java and then plan to migrate and implement similar work in other languages like C++ above.

For in depth detail of the contents of this folder please view the README withing the `Java` folder.

## Truffle Folder

This folder contains my work with ERC20 Token design and my learning of Eutherium's language solidity.

Within this folder there are 2 project folders, a default truffle example project example `MetaCoin` and my own project that I have been creating `PyramidCoin` with reference to the solidity docs and `MetaCoin`.
